    "reason": "Ambiguity issue: The phrase \"APMA 940 will be accepted in lieu of MATH 775\" implies that APMA 940 is a prerequisite that can substitute for MATH 775. The schema has a `RequirementCourse` type with an `orEquivalent` field. However, `orEquivalent` is typically used for cases like \"MATH 101 or equivalent,\" meaning the *course itself* (MATH 101) has equivalents. The phrasing here is about an *alternative prerequisite*.\n\nThe most direct interpretation is that APMA 940 is the prerequisite. The schema can represent this as `prerequisite: { type: 'course', department: 'APMA', number: '940' }`. The nuance of \"in lieu of MATH 775\" is not directly captured by a specific field in the schema. While `orEquivalent` exists, its application here is ambiguous. If `orEquivalent: 'true'` on `RequirementCourse` means \"this course can be satisfied by another course,\" it doesn't specify *which* other course.\n\nGiven the schema's structure, the most accurate representation of \"APMA 940 will be accepted in lieu of MATH 775\" is to list APMA 940 as the prerequisite. The schema does not have a dedicated field to specify that a prerequisite course is accepted *in lieu of* another specific course. Therefore, while the core prerequisite can be captured, the specific relationship (\"in lieu of\") is lost.\n\nHowever, the question is whether the requirements can be *clearly and unambiguously represented*. The phrase \"accepted in lieu of\" is a common way to state that an alternative course fulfills a requirement. The schema's `RequirementCourse` type with `orEquivalent` is the closest fit, but it's not a perfect match for specifying *which* alternative.\n\nLet's re-evaluate:\n1.  \"Students with credit for MATH 475 may not take this course for further credit.\"\n    *   This is a credit conflict. It can be represented as:\n        ```json\n        \"credit_conflicts\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"conflict_course\",\n            \"department\": \"MATH\",\n            \"number\": \"475\"\n          }\n        ]\n        ```\n    *   This is clearly supported.\n\n2.  \"APMA 940 will be accepted in lieu of MATH 775.\"\n    *   This means APMA 940 is a prerequisite.\n    *   The schema has `RequirementCourse` with `orEquivalent?: 'true'`.\n    *   If we interpret \"accepted in lieu of\" as a form of equivalence for the prerequisite, we could try to fit it.\n    *   Option A: `prerequisite: { type: 'course', department: 'APMA', number: '940' }`. This captures that APMA 940 is required, but loses the \"in lieu of MATH 775\" context.\n    *   Option B: `prerequisite: { type: 'course', department: 'MATH', number: '775', orEquivalent: 'true' }`. This implies MATH 775 itself has equivalents, which isn't quite right. It doesn't specify *what* is equivalent.\n    *   The schema lacks a direct way to say \"Prerequisite: Course A, which is accepted in lieu of Course B\". The `orEquivalent` field is on the *course being satisfied*, not the *alternative course*.\n\nThe most common interpretation of \"X will be accepted in lieu of Y\" is that X is a prerequisite. The schema *can* represent this as `prerequisite: { type: 'course', department: 'APMA', number: '940' }`. The nuance that APMA 940 is specifically \"in lieu of MATH 775\" is not directly captured by a dedicated field. However, the *requirement* itself (APMA 940) is representable.\n\nThe question is about *clear and unambiguous representation*. While the *exact phrasing* \"accepted in lieu of\" might not have a perfect one-to-one mapping, the *functional requirement* (APMA 940 is a prerequisite) is clear and representable. The `orEquivalent` field is the closest, but its placement and typical usage suggest it's for the course *itself* having equivalents, not for an alternative prerequisite.\n\nGiven the schema, the most reasonable interpretation is that APMA 940 is a prerequisite. The schema doesn't have a field to specify *why* it's a prerequisite (i.e., in lieu of another course). This lack of specificity for the \"in lieu of\" context could be considered a limitation, but not necessarily an ambiguity that prevents representation of the core requirement.\n\nLet's consider if there's any other interpretation. If the intent was that MATH 775 is a prerequisite, and APMA 940 is an alternative *to taking MATH 775*, that's different. But \"accepted in lieu of MATH 775\" usually means APMA 940 is the prerequisite.\n\nThe schema does not have a field to specify that a prerequisite course is accepted *in lieu of* another specific course. It only allows specifying the prerequisite course itself. The `orEquivalent` field on `RequirementCourse` is for when the *required course itself* has equivalents.\n\nTherefore, the phrase \"APMA 940 will be accepted in lieu of MATH 775\" can be represented as a prerequisite of APMA 940, but the specific context of it being \"in lieu of MATH 775\" is not explicitly captured by a dedicated field. This is a limitation in expressiveness, but the core requirement is representable.\n\nThe question is about *clear and unambiguous representation*. The fact that the schema doesn't have a specific field for \"accepted in lieu of\" means that this particular nuance cannot be *unambiguously* represented. While we can represent APMA 940 as a prerequisite, the *reason* for that prerequisite (as a substitute for MATH 775) is lost. This is a lack of schema support for a specific nuance.\n\nFinal check:\n- Credit conflict: Supported.\n- Prerequisite (APMA 940): Supported as a course prerequisite.\n- Nuance of \"in lieu of MATH 775\": Not directly supported by a specific field. The `orEquivalent` field is for the course itself having equivalents.\n\nThis lack of a specific field for \"accepted in lieu of\" means the requirement cannot be *fully and unambiguously* represented in its entirety.\n\n. The phrase \"APMA 940 will be accepted in lieu of MATH 775\" implies that APMA 940 is a prerequisite that substitutes for MATH 775. The schema has `RequirementCourse` with an `orEquivalent` field, but this field is typically used when the *course itself* has equivalents (e.g., \"MATH 101 or equivalent\"). There isn't a specific field to denote that one prerequisite course is accepted *in lieu of* another specific course.
