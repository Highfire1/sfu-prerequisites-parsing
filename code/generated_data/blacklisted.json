The schema supports `RequirementPermission` for such cases.\n\n2.  **\"Students who have completed JAPN 210 or 301 can also enroll in the course.\"**\n    *   This phrase indicates an alternative path to satisfy the prerequisite. It translates to another `RequirementGroup` with `logic: 'ONE_OF'`.\n    *   The children are `RequirementCourse` entries for \"JAPN 210\" and \"JAPN 301\".\n\n3.  **Combining the first two points:** The phrasing \"JAPN 300 or a placement interview. Students who have completed JAPN 210 or 301 can also enroll...\" implies that *either* the first condition set *or* the second condition set must be met. This structure is represented by a top-level `RequirementGroup` with `logic: 'ONE_OF'`, containing the two `ONE_OF` groups described above.\n\n4.  **\"Course participants are expected to be able to read at least 300 kanji (Chinese characters), and to follow instructions in Japanese.\"**\n    *   These are qualitative skill-based requirements. The schema does not have specific types for \"language proficiency\" or \"skill requirements.\" However, the `RequirementOther` type is designed for \"any other requirement that does not fit into the above categories.\"\n    *   This translates to a `RequirementOther` node with a `note` field containing the combined statement: \"Must be able to read at least 300 kanji (Chinese characters) and follow instructions in Japanese.\"\n\n5.  **Overall Structure:** The requirement that *both* the course/interview conditions *and* the proficiency conditions must be met is represented by a top-level `RequirementGroup` with `logic: 'ALL_OF'`. This group contains the combined prerequisite structure from point 3 and the `RequirementOther` node from point 4.\n\nThe schema supports all components of the requirement: specific courses, alternative logic (`ONE_OF`), permission-based requirements (via `RequirementPermission`), and general qualitative requirements (via `RequirementOther`).
