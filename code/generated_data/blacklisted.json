It is unclear if the \"one lower division ARCH course\" must be a separate course from the one used to satisfy the \"ARCH 101 or ARCH 201\" requirement. The JSON represents a literal interpretation where a single course (e.g., ARCH 101) could satisfy both conditions, which may not be the intended meaning."

It could be interpreted in two ways:\n1. `(ARCH 101 or ARCH 201) AND (ARCH 272/272W or 273)`\n2. `ARCH 101 OR (ARCH 201 AND (ARCH 272/272W or 273))`\n\nThe parsed JSON represents the first interpretation, but the second is also a plausible reading of the text. Without clarification, it is impossible to determine the intended logic."
